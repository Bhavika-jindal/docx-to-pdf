GitHub Actions Workflow
The repository is integrated with GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment of the Docker image:

CI Pipeline: Whenever a change is pushed to the main branch, a new Docker image will be built and pushed to Docker Hub.
Example dockerfile.yml for GitHub Actions:
yaml
Copy code
name: Build and Deploy Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

    - name: Cache Docker layers
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: /tmp/.buildx-cache
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-${{ github.sha }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-

    - name: Build Docker image
      run: |
        docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/docx-to-pdf .
